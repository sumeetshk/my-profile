I'm a senior database administrator and reliability engineer managing powerful (PostgreSQL, Amazon RDS/Aurora, MySQL, GreenPlum, Redshift, MongoDB, SQL Server) databases for more than 10 years now. I spent initial 3 years of my career with projects on Web Design/Development (PHP, jQuery, Wordpress, Magento), BigData (Hadoop Ecosystem) and Business Intelligence & Data warehousing(BIDW). For the past 4 years I'm also working as Site Reliability Engineer and working closely on AWS Cloud Services (RDS, Aurora, EC2, S3, CDN, Redshift, IAM, VPC, Route53, Load Balancer, DynamoDB), Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, Packer, and Kubernetes along with various DevOps Tools and Techniques.

My day to day responsibilities include:
- Dealing with product owners, understanding their requirement, capacity planning, getting the servers provisioned, configure it for optimal performance.
- Installing, Upgrading & Configuring PostgreSQL servers, determining backup strategies & security procedures and setting up HA (High Availability) & DR (Disaster Recovery) sites.
- Interacting with developers, reviewing the performance reports and helping them with slow performing queries.
- Performance Benchmarking and Server tuning for maximum resource utilization to squeeze best performance out of it.
- Scripting and Automating regular tasks.
- Researching and configuring various tools for monitoring, alerting and troubleshooting applications.
- Project/Team Management - defining OKR's, planning roadmaps, using agile methodologies (Scrum/Kanban) along with various open source tools for improved outcomes.

I believe in consistent growth and indulge in continuous learning even though it's not a direct requirement for the job. I find that it almost always helps directly or indirectly at work. I'm well aware of my capabilities on executing difficult tasks successfully in an autonomous manner. I have demonstrated an unwavering resolve to do whatever must be done to produce the best long-term results, no matter how difficult. Hence, I have been consistently able to exceed the set expectations.
